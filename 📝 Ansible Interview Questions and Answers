1. **Q: What is Ansible?**
   - Ansible is an open-source automation tool used for configuration management, application deployment, and task automation. 
     It simplifies the management and orchestration of IT infrastructure by using declarative language and agentless architecture.

2. **Q: What is the difference between Ansible and other configuration management tools like Chef or Puppet?**
   - Unlike other tools that rely on a master-agent architecture, Ansible follows an agentless approach. It communicates with remote 
     hosts using SSH or WinRM, which makes it easy to set up and manage. Ansible also uses a simple YAML syntax for playbooks, 
     making it more human-readable and easier to learn.

3. **Q: What are Ansible playbooks?**
   - Ansible playbooks are YAML files that define a set of tasks to be executed on remote hosts. They provide a way to automate complex 
     configurations, deployments, and orchestration by organizing tasks in a logical structure.

4. **Q: What is an Ansible role?**
   - An Ansible role is a pre-defined set of tasks, templates, variables, and files that can be reused across multiple playbooks. 
     Roles promote modularization and reusability, making it easier to organize and maintain Ansible code.

5. **Q: How does Ansible ensure idempotency?**
   - Ansible ensures idempotency by checking the current state of the system before executing a task. It only performs the necessary actions to 
     bring the system to the desired state, regardless of how many times the task is executed. This prevents unintended changes and allows for 
     safe and predictable automation.

6. **Q: How can you handle sensitive data, such as passwords, in Ansible?**
   - Ansible provides a feature called Ansible Vault to encrypt and decrypt sensitive data. Vault allows you to securely store passwords, 
     API keys, or other confidential information in your playbooks or variable files.

7. **Q: What is the difference between Ansible tasks and handlers?**
   - Tasks are units of work performed by Ansible, while handlers are special tasks that are only executed when triggered. 
     Handlers are typically used to respond to specific events, such as service restarts or configuration changes.

8. **Q: How can you manage multiple servers or hosts in Ansible?**
   - Ansible uses an inventory file to manage multiple servers or hosts. The inventory file lists the hostnames or IP addresses of the servers and 
     groups them into categories. It allows you to define variables and group-specific settings for different sets of hosts.

9. **Q: What are Ansible facts?**
   - Ansible facts are system information collected from remote hosts during the playbook execution. Facts include details like the operating system,
     IP addresses, hardware information, and more. They can be used as variables in playbooks to make automation more dynamic.

10. **Q: How can you debug Ansible playbooks?**
    - Ansible provides various methods for debugging, such as the `debug` module, which allows you to print variable values or 
      debug messages during playbook execution. You can also use the `ansible-playbook` command with the `-vvv` option to get 
      verbose output and track the execution flow.
